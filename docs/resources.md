# Inspiration

The inspiration from this project was somewhat unclear. We are both interested in music theory and signal processing, but largely we were just excited to build a hardware accelerator for an operation that is critical to modern computer. Harmonizing with input audio is just one example of the many applications of our system, but it was one that interested us both and seemed feasible.
