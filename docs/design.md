# Design
<!-- Include images of the schematics for your system. They should follow best practices for schematic drawings with all parts and pins clearly labeled. You may draw your schematics either with a software tool or neatly by hand. -->

# MCU Design
<!-- This section should include information to describe the organization of the code base and highlight how the code connects. -->
The main components of the MCU include the usage of an ADC (Analog to Digital Converter), and the SPI module within the MCU. 

The source code for the project is located in the Github repository [here](https://github.com/brianSimpkins/E155_Final/tree/main/src).
